Problem Statement

Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high 
and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the service on the fly or jump to Uber depending on the rates.

As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, Ola is casting a wide net, 
including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the 
morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

You are working as a data scientist with the Analytics Department of Ola, focused on driver team attrition. You are provided 
with the monthly information for a segment of drivers for 2019 and 2020 and tasked to predict whether a driver will be leaving 
the company or not based on their attributes like

Demographics (city, age, gender etc.)
Tenure information (joining date, Last Date)
Historical data regarding the performance of the driver (Quarterly rating, Monthly business acquired, grade, Income)

Actionable Insights:

Education level plays a significant role in churn rates, suggesting Ola should consider tailored retention strategies for drivers with lower education levels.

Drivers with low quarterly ratings exhibit higher churn rates, indicating the need for support programs to enhance driver ratings and overall satisfaction.

Churn rates were notably high in 2018 and 2019, prompting Ola to investigate the factors contributing to these peaks during those years.

Key model features impacting churn include 'joining year', 'total business value', highlighting areas for focused intervention and improvement.

Providing financial literacy training could benefit drivers, as increased income was linked to reduced churn rates.

Establishing a mentorship program pairing new drivers with experienced ones may enhance driver performance and retention.

Targeted communication and support for drivers with lower education levels could help mitigate churn.

Conducting regular feedback sessions and engagement activities can provide valuable insights into driver challenges and improve overall satisfaction.

Given the correlation between joining year and churn, reviewing the onboarding process for high-churn years is recommended.

Implementing mechanisms for drivers to express concerns about business opportunities could help match them with high-demand routes.

Analyzing peak business times and routes can optimize driver earnings and decrease churn likelihood.

Ensuring a fair benefits distribution system can enhance driver satisfaction and loyalty.

Recommendations:
Address factors leading to lower ratings through training and support initiatives to improve driver performance.
Consider implementing a rewards program for drivers maintaining high ratings consistently.
Reach out to drivers who joined in high-churn years to understand their reasons for leaving and improve support mechanisms.
Offer tenure-based benefits or loyalty recognition to incentivize long-term driver engagement.
Encourage drivers to increase their total business value through milestone-based incentives.
Maintain robust data collection practices like proper records of drivers enhances predictive modeling and address driver concerns effectively.
